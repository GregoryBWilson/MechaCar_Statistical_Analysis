# MechaCar Statistical Analysis



## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

✓The csv file is imported and read into a dataframe. 

✓An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on ALL SIX variables. 

✓An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values. 

✓The summary addresses all THREE questions.

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

✓The csv file is imported and read into a dataframe. 

✓The total summary dataframe has ALL FOUR metrics for all the manufacturing lots. 

✓The lot summary dataframe has ALL FOUR metrics for each manufacturing lot. 

✓The summary addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and ALL THREE lots.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

✓An RScript is written for a t-test that compares all manufacturing lots against the mean PSI of the population. 

✓An RScript is written for ALL THREE t-tests that compare each manufacturing lot against the mean PSI of the population. 

✓The summary addresses the results across all manufacturing lots and ALL THREE lots.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

The statistical study design has the following: 

✓A metric to be tested is mentioned. 

✓A null or alternative hypothesis is described. 

✓A statistical test is well described to test the hypothesis. 

✓The data for the statistical test is well described.
